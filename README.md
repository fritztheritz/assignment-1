Fritz Duverglas

I am a senior at Brandeis University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in African and African American Studies. Upon graduation in May, I will become a software engineer for Publicis Sapient (a tech consulting company). I took this course because I am interesting in learning more about data analysis and was intrigued by the environmental studies angle for the course. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, listening to music, watching Youtube videos, and hanging out with friends.
